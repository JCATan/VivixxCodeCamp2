	<h1>European Dragon</h1>
	<h2> European dragons are legendary creatures in folklore and mythology among the overlapping cultures of Europe.

	In the modern period, the European dragon is typically depicted as a large, fire-breathing, scaly, horned, lizard-like creature; the creature also has leathery, bat-like wings, four legs, and a long, muscular prehensile tail. Some depictions show dragons with feathered wings, crests, ear frills, fiery manes, ivory spikes running down its spine, and various exotic decorations. Others have no legs or multiple heads.

	In folktales, dragon's blood often contains unique powers, keeping them alive for longer or giving them poisonous or acidic properties. For example, in the opera Siegfried, dragon's blood allows Siegfried to understand the language of the Forest Bird. The typical dragon protects a cavern or castle filled with gold and treasure. An evil dragon is often associated with a great hero who tries to slay it, and a good one is said to give wise advice.

	Though a winged creature, the dragon is generally to be found in its underground lair, a cave that identifies it as an ancient creature of earth. Possibly, the dragons of European and Mid-Eastern mythology stem from misunderstood fossils and exaggerations of species of poisonous lizards and snakes.<br>
